This project was developed as part of my MSc thesis in Cultural Informatics and Communication (University of the Aegean).
It is an interactive first-person application created in Unity, aiming to digitally revive the traditional art of weaving and the use of the loom, as well as other traditional tools.

The application allows the user to explore a virtual environment and interact with cultural objects, focusing on learning through experience and immersion.
